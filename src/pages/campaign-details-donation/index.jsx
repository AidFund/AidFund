    story: `My name is Maria Santos, and I am a 34-year-old mother of two beautiful children, ages 8 and 12. Three months ago, my world turned upside down when I was diagnosed with a severe congenital heart defect that requires immediate surgical intervention.

The doctors at St. Mary's Medical Center have informed me that I need a heart valve replacement surgery within the next month to prevent further complications. Without this surgery, my condition will continue to deteriorate, and I may not be able to see my children grow up.

As a single mother working two part-time jobs, I have been struggling to make ends meet even before this diagnosis. The estimated cost of the surgery, including pre-operative care, the procedure itself, and post-operative recovery, is $85,000. My insurance will only cover a portion of these expenses, leaving me with an overwhelming financial burden.

I have exhausted all my savings and have reached out to family and friends, but the amount needed is beyond what we can manage alone. This is why I am humbly asking for your help and support during this incredibly difficult time.

Every donation, no matter how small, brings me one step closer to getting the life-saving surgery I desperately need. Your generosity will not only help save my life but will also ensure that my children don't lose their mother.

I promise to keep everyone updated on my progress and recovery. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for taking the time to read my story and for any support you can provide.`,

The good news is that I'm a good candidate for the valve replacement surgery. The surgical team is confident about the procedure and expects a full recovery within 6-8 weeks post-surgery.

Surgery has been scheduled for December 15th, 2024. I'm feeling nervous but hopeful, especially with all the support from this amazing community. Thank you to everyone who has donated so far - we're at 54% of our goal!I'll continue to update everyone as we get closer to the surgery date.`,

Special thanks to all the anonymous donors and to Sarah Johnson, Michael Chen, and Emma Rodriguez for their generous contributions and kind words. Reading your messages of support brings tears to my eyes and gives me strength to keep fighting.

My children are also amazed by the kindness of strangers. My 12-year-old daughter asked if she could write thank you cards to everyone who donated. It's beautiful to see how this experience is teaching them about compassion and community.

We still have a long way to go, but I'm feeling more hopeful each day. Thank you for believing in me and my recovery.`,
